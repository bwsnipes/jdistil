# JDistil

[JDistil](http://www.jdistil.com) is an open source, independent, full stack, lightweight and extensible framework focused on simplifying application development and reducing the amount of time required to build Java web applications. The framework is built using simple design principles and supports the functionality commonly required by data centric applications. The following key features are included in the core framework. 
  - Action based MVC model.
  - Code based application configuration.
  - Code based ORM support with dynamic query capabilities.
  - UI component model supporting logic-less JSP pages.
  - Extendible action and field level validation.
  - Extendible user authentication.
  - Extendible action and field level authorization.
  - Support for internationalization (i18n).
  - Independence from third party libraries.

JDistil further simplifies application development by providing two open source default modules and an Eclipse plugin. The default modules support common application functions and the plugin supports domain model based code generation. The following provides additional detail on these items.
  - Default Modules
    - Codes - Administration and component support for application specific codes.
    - Security - Administration and component support for user authentication and role based authorization.

  - Code Generation
   - Project Facet - Enriches an Eclipse dynamic web project by adding all required JDistil resources.
   - Application Fragment Wizard - Generates domain model based application resources representing an application fragment.
   - Fragment Relationship Wizard - Updates application resources to establish a relationship between two application fragments.
