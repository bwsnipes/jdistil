      END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT

By installing or using the Bryan W. Snipes (the “Company”) product JDistil Plugin (the “Software”) you indicate your agreement to the terms of this End User License Agreement (the “Agreement”).  If you do not agree to the terms herein, you are not authorized to copy or use the Software.  The Software, all images, photographs, icons, and text incorporated in the Software, is owned by Company or its suppliers and is protected by United States copyright laws and international treaty provisions.  Except to the extent expressly licensed herein, all rights are reserved to Company and its suppliers.  You may not reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the Software except as set forth herein.

ATTENTION:  USE OF THE SOFTWARE IS SUBJECT TO THE TERMS SET FORTH BELOW.  USING THE SOFTWARE INDICATES YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THESE TERMS.  IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THESE TERMS YOU ARE NOT AUTHORIZED TO USE THIS SOFTWARE.


1.    LICENSE GRANT
The Company grants you a non-exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide right and license to use the executable version of the Software, where “use” in this Agreement means storing, loading, installing or executing the Software.  You may not modify the Software or disable any licensing or control features of the Software. You agree that you may not copy the written materials accompanying the Software.  You may copy the software for archival purposes so long as the copy is unmodified from the original distribution and the copy retains all of the original Software’s proprietary notices. You may not rent or lease your rights to the Software or documentation. If you are an individual and this Agreement is for a single license, you may install the Software on multiple computers provided that not more than one of those computers is in use simultaneously and that those computers are solely for your own use. If the Software license you have is for a single user license then the Software may be installed on a computer that is for multiple users but it may not be installed on more than one computer regardless of whether those computers are operated simultaneously or not. If this Agreement is for a multi-user (site) license, the number of computers on which the Software is installed may not exceed the number of licenses purchased, regardless of whether the computer is used by multiple users or not. You may use this software in a networked environment on computers other than the computer on which the software is installed provided that you have purchased licenses for each computer that will use the software, regardless of whether those computers will use the software at the same time or not. 
  
2.    OWNERSHIP
All right, title and interest in and to the Software is owned and copyrighted by the Company or its third party suppliers. Your license confers neither title to nor ownership in the Software and is not a sale of any rights in the Company. Company third party suppliers may protect their rights in the event of any violation of this License Agreement as if such suppliers were parties to this License Agreement.  No license is given to you under any patent or patent application of Company.

3.    COPIES AND ADAPTATIONS
Other than as provided in the License Grant section of this agreement, you may only make copies or adaptations of the Software for archival purposes or when copying or adaptation is an essential step in the authorized use of the Software. You must reproduce all copyright notices in the original Software on all copies or adaptations.

4.    NO DISASSEMBLY, RECOMPILATION OR DECRYPTION
You may not disassemble or decompile the Software unless Company prior written consent is obtained. In some jurisdictions, Company consent may not be required for limited disassembly or decompilation.  Upon request, you will provide Company with reasonably detailed information regarding any disassembly or decompilation. You may not decrypt the Software unless decryption is an essential step in the authorized use of the Software.
If you have obtained a source code version of this program, you may use the unmodified binary executable in accordance with this Agreement, but source code for the Product is not covered by this Agreement. Source code is provided exclusively as an educational service and you agree that all responsibility for all use of source code is yours alone and that Company assumes no responsibility for any use of source code by you.  

5.    NO WARRANTIES

BECAUSE SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. FURTHERMORE, THE COMPANY’S LIABILITY FOR DIRECT DAMAGES SHALL NOT EXCEED THE LICENSE FEE, IF ANY, PAID BY YOU DIRECTLY TO THE COMPANY FOR USE OF THE PRODUCT OR ANY LICENSE FEE RECEIVED BY THE COMPANY FOR THE USE OF THE PRODUCT IF PURCHASED THROUGH AN AUTHORIZED THIRD PARTY.

Obligations to pay accrued charges or fees shall survive the termination of this Agreement. 

10.    ASSIGNMENT AND NON-ASSIGNMENT

If you are an individual and this Agreement is for a multi-user license, or you are not an individual and are an entity, then you may not assign your rights under this Agreement without the prior written permission of the Company. If you are an entity that merges with or is acquired by another entity then your rights under this Agreement shall be deemed to be temporarily assigned to the resulting entity of that merge or acquisition provided that you supply the Company with written notice not later than the date on which any public announcement of that merger or acquisition is made.  Upon receipt of written notice, the Company shall have thirty (30) days to either accept or reject the assignment of rights.

In the event that you breach this Agreement or indicate your intention to breach this Agreement in any manner that violates or may violate the Company’s intellectual property rights or may cause continuing or irreparable harm to the Company, the Company may seek injunctive relief in any court of competent jurisdiction. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is specifically disclaimed.
